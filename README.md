Robopy. Initial content

Base is implemented with 10 python files. This is the first the part, which contain init file for import, file with arguments and common file with the main functions for matrix type definition
Those files comprised of functions to determine the position of robot, function to build model and to draw graphics
Serial_link is needed to create links and after that group them to the robot. Quarternion is a method t calculate Forward and inverse kinematics of the robot. Super pose file contains modyfied functions to define the position
Transform file contains functions to implement operations between matrices. Util file to delete your model and make changes after that
folder there are images of the floor and robotype logot
In images folder there are images of the floor and robotype logot
Orion5 project contains 7 stl files which describe it’s 3D model of each link
Puma 560 project contains 7 stl files which describe it’s 3D model of each link. Puma is 7-linked robot including the base
This test files include test data to prove the correctness of a model

When you add docs folder, Images are available.
